# RimeSkins
Two cute Rime skins. Many Thanks to my lovely girl YuYu who inspires me to make these skins!

**Instruction:**
1. Type "Win+R". Open "%appdata%". Find "AppData\Roaming\Rime".
Copy the codes in "weasel.custom.yaml" and paste it in "AppData\Roaming\Rime\weasel.custom.yaml"
2. Copy "color_scheme_ILoveYuYu.png" and "color_scheme_YuYuLoveMe.png", then paste them in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Rime\weasel-0.15.0\data\preview"
3. Run "[Weasel]Deploy" in Windows Starts menau or right-click on the type icon and run 重新部屬

Now you may switch to any skins in 輸入法設定 as your wish!🥰
